==========
* Modified the help so that it's not useless anymore.
* Program checks for types beginning with std:: and import the corresponding header automatically.
* Some type / header name correspondance have been manually added, so it works for them even without std::.
* Corrected few syntax typos to make the rendering more pretty.
